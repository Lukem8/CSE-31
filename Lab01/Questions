Q1. The -c flag compiles the source file without linking.

Q2. The -o flag links the object files of the program. It writes the build output to the output file.

Q3. The command to load output0 into gdb is:
	gdb ./output0

Q4. break main

Q5. run

Q6. step

Q7. Unsigned int is 32 bits (4 bytes)

Q8. Long int is 64 bits (8 bytes)

Q9. Yes, both signed and unsigned ints are 32 bits (4 bytes)

Q10. The output is -2147483648 which is 1000 0000 0000 0000 (twos complement).
     When you negate the most negative signed int you get 0111 1111 1111 1111 + 1,
     which becomes 1000 0000 0000 0000 (twos complement so first bit tells us it's negative) which is why the output shows -2147483648.
